              <p class = "p1">I am from South Africa, born on January 11 1990.<br>I moved to America about 4/5 years ago.<br>
              I love working out and I love obstacle races because I think it's one of the best ways to test yourself and your limits.<br>
             I started to code about a year ago, I picked up my first coding book which was "Coding for Dummies" then I finished that and picked up "Coding for Beginners."<br>I began to be able to look at code and see the problems in them.
             I want to be one of the best in the world for web development, my end goal is to be able to have my own company to create web pages/programs and be able to host and secure them. I want to get into cyber security, that is what I see myself moving toward. </p>
